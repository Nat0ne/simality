Elena stood at the market square, her eyes darting from stall to stall. The vibrancy that once pulsed through the marketplace felt like a distant memory. Now, the stalls were sparsely filled, and the sellers' eyes held a similar desperation to the customers’.

She remembered times when the weight of her coin pouch would guarantee her a basket full of vegetables, fruits, and perhaps a small treat for her son, Leo. But the weight of the coins hadn’t changed; it was their power that had diminished.

At Mr. Sandoval’s stall, where Elena usually bought her vegetables, a single apple now required a handful of coins. She hesitated, calculating the days until her next payment, then slowly handed over almost a day’s wages for a few poor vegetables.

Her steps were heavy as she made her way home. The streets were filled with murmurs. Neighbors whispered of selling ancestral lands, of children dropping out of school, and of days gone by when a single coin could buy a loaf of bread.

Elena’s small home came into view, the wooden door slightly ajar. Inside, Leo was playing with small toy soldiers, his innocent face lit up with imagination. The thought of him made her heart both swell with love and ache with anxiety.

“Mama! Look, the soldiers are guarding the kingdom!” Leo exclaimed, holding up a wooden figurine.

Elena smiled, kneeling beside him. “That’s wonderful, darling.”

But her thoughts were on the empty pantry. She wondered how she would explain to Leo that tonight, dinner would be scarce. Again.

Weeks turned into months. The weight of despair in the town grew. Elena's employer, a once-prosperous tailor, had to let go of half his staff, including her. The fabric shipments were less frequent, the coins fewer, and the customers' orders had become infrequent luxuries.

Late one evening, as the silver light of the moon filtered through their windows, Leo pulled at Elena’s sleeve, his face pale. “Mama, why does my stomach hurt?”

Elena looked into her son's eyes, seeing the shadows of hunger. The pain in her chest was sharp, more profound than any personal hunger or need. She held him close, humming a lullaby, hoping to soothe his pain with love and song.

In the following morning Elena decided to visit the riverbank. Years ago, the townspeople would often gather there, sharing stories while casting nets, hoping for a bountiful catch. Perhaps she might find some solace, or even fish.

The bank was deserted, save for an old man, Manuel. His once bright eyes looked cloudy, his face etched with deep lines of worry.

“Elena,” he greeted with a nod. “Trying your luck?”

She nodded, throwing her improvised net into the river. Time passed, and the sun began its descent. Both their nets remained tragically empty.

Manuel finally broke the silence, "The river, it's changed. It feels... tired. Like it's given all it can.”

Elena looked at the water, thinking of how everything, even nature, felt the strain of their once-prosperous town's decline. “We can only hope,” she whispered, more to herself than to Manuel.

Returning home with empty hands and a heavier heart, tears streamed down Elena's face. To her fear, upon her arrival, Leo was nowhere in sight. Panicking, Elena searched the house and then the streets. She came across a group of children, who said they saw Leo heading towards the forest, talking about a rumored tree laden with fruits.

The forest, with its gnarled trees and uncertain paths, was known to be treacherous. Elena's heart raced as she delved into its depths, calling out Leo's name.

Hours felt like days until she came across a clearing where she saw Leo's toy soldier, and beside it, a deep pit. The realization hit her like a tidal wave.

Rushing to the pit's edge, her worst fears were confirmed. Leo had fallen in while desperately searching for food, the unforgiving terrain having concealed the danger.

Beneath the silver skies, in a world where the value of everything had shifted, a mother's heartbreak became a somber testament to a time when life's essentials became unattainable luxuries.
